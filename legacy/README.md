# Legacy Pages

The HTML entry points for the standalone operator and question admin tools are no longer served directly. They are
kept here as a reference snapshot for developers who may need to inspect the previous UI layouts.

* `operator.html` – legacy entry for the telop operator console
* `question-admin.html` – legacy entry for the participant/question administration view

If you need to revive either screen as a public page, move it back to the project root and ensure any new security
requirements (authentication, CSP updates, etc.) are reviewed before deployment.
